# 16-Bit-CPU
Design of a 16-Bit CPU using VHDL  

First, the various components of the CPU were programmed. Next, the control unit was designed using the port mapping techniques. Finally,
the CPU was put together at the last stage. The programming was done in VHDL. Testbenches were written for individual components at each 
stage to verify the functioning. 

The components used were:
1. ALU  
  a. Arithmatic Unit  
  b. Logic Unit  
  c. Shifter  
2. Data Memory
3. Instruction memory
4. Program Counter
5. Instruction Register
6. Multiplexer
7. Controller
8. CPU
